# Deferred work

Track items we consciously put off. Add a row when parking work; remove or mark done when shipped.

| Task | Value / what it unlocks | Why deferred | Revisit when |
|------|-------------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Unit picker on tenant dialog (set `Tenants.unit_id` without going through a lease) | Direct assign for portfolio tenants before/without lease CRUD | WS-G shipped lease create/update/delete sync (gap R3); optional UI kept S | Next tenants UX pass |
| Lease tenant/unit sync as a single DB RPC/transaction (`FOR UPDATE`) | Fully atomic create/update/delete; closes residual races (delete∩update TOCTOU; multi-step sync vs a newer CAS winner) beyond FE CAS + `assertLeaseLinkState` + superseded repair | WS-G stayed FE/`data.ts`-only: CAS, absolute occupant set, before/after rechecks, repair without overwriting winner | If concurrent admin edits collide in prod, or next schema AuthZ pass |
| Return single lease from create/update without full `listLeases()` enrich | Fewer RTTs on lease save | Pre-existing pattern; WS-G left return path unchanged | Next rent/leases perf pass |
| ~~Payment ledger / status **RPC tests** (record, delete, SUM vs drift, non-admin deny, direct Payment DML deny)~~ | ~~Catches ledger regressions before multi-staff~~ | **Done (WS-J)** — `tests/requirements/r7-permissions.test.ts` payment ledger RPCs | Shipped with Wave 2 test expansion |
| Soft-fail bootstrap / surface `generateCharges` errors via popup/toast | Admins see failed charge creation instead of silent skips | UX polish; not AuthZ; High/Must Phase 1.5 done | Next rent/charges UX pass or when charge generation is used in production |
| Lazy-load `MaintenanceRequestStaffNotes` on WO dialog open (not every `listWorkOrders`) | Smaller list payloads for landlords/tenants/dashboard | WS-E ships batched notes enrich on list for staff UX parity; not AuthZ | Next maintenance UX / perf pass (WS-N) |
| Dashboard / charges **N+1** query reduction | Faster dashboard + rent list under larger portfolios | Perf only; not blocking Phase 1.5 or Phase 2 DoD | When portfolio size or Lighthouse/load complaints make list latency visible |
| Service-role / SQL Editor **trigger guard** on Payments (block DML unless via RPC or explicit bypass) | Closes ledger bypass for privileged DB roles | Authenticated path already RPC-only after dropping Payment write policies; service role is ops-only today | Before granting broad SQL access to non-ops, or if ops mistakes rewrite Payments outside RPCs |
| **Portal hosting + URL: deferred until owner provides the link** (**roadmap #3** = hygiene **#13**) — deploy portal + set website `NEXT_PUBLIC_PORTAL_URL` / login-link wiring; launch new Next.js site; retire live WordPress | Unlocks real production CTAs and stops serving compromised WordPress | **Out of Wave 3 / out of WS-I** by owner decision (2026-11-14). Live `landlordgopher.com` is still the **old WordPress** site (spam-compromised; `/login` redirects to casino — **do not browse for “QA”**). New Next.js marketing site (`landlordgopherwebsite_`) is **not deployed** to that domain yet. Same Auth project `bgjkjtfgrfiszbzatriq` when wired. Do **not** confuse with hygiene **#3** (revoke anon EXECUTE on payment RPCs / WS-S S2) | When owner provides the portal/website link and go-ahead to cut over DNS / hosting |
| **Supabase staging branch** (**WS-I** / hygiene **#8**) — create `staging` on `bgjkjtfgrfiszbzatriq` | Apply DDL before production; stop live-only drift | **Paused** — details/cost in [`docs/ops/schema-migrations.md`](./ops/schema-migrations.md) § Staging recommendation (SoT) | After owner confirms cost in ops doc; create `staging` + record `project_ref` there |
| **Repair MCP migration version stamps / duplicate history** (**WS-I** / hygiene **#8**) | Stops CLI/`db push` treating applied SQL as pending | **Plan documented** in ops § one-shot repair / §E (SoT). Live repair **not executed** (ops go-ahead; staging optional; no DDL) | On ops go-ahead: run §E; verify `list_migrations`; mark done |
| ~~Required CI on `master` PRs (`pnpm typecheck` / `build` / `test`)~~ | ~~Merge gate safety net~~ | **Done (WS-S S1)** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` + `docs/ops/ci-required-checks.md`; **owner must click** branch protection to mark check required | After first green CI run on the PR/branch |
| ~~Archive D1/Hono/Clawnify + retire `main` sync~~ | ~~Stop claiming Worker/D1 as primary path~~ | **Done (WS-S S1)** — under `archive/`; `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN` → pointer; `sync-branches.yml` removed; `main` retired (master-only) | — |
| Phase 1.5 **Medium polish** from [#5](https://github.com/CharmZoned/Maintenance-App-Portal/pull/5): guard null `updated` after RPC; document that any payment clears `waived`; decide `amount = 0` never → `paid` rule | Belt-and-suspenders client safety + intentional product rules | Non-blocking after High ledger fixes on `70a9468`; merge already approved; live payment RPCs applied 2026-11-13 (LGA-16) | Next rent/ledger UX pass or before multi-staff |
| Ambiguous signup emails (match >1 of Landlord/Tenant/Staff) leave Auth user with **no** `user_roles` row | Admin must assign role manually on Users (upsert via RPC) | Rare; trigger refuses to guess | If multi-entity emails become common, add admin “create role” affordance or pick priority |
| Route landlord ownership helpers (e.g. `private.landlord_owns_unit`) through hardened `current_landlord_id()` (role + approved) | Pending or re-roled users cannot use a stale `user_roles.landlord_id` for SELECT | **Done (WS-E)** — `20261114030000_harden_landlord_helpers_and_mr_notes.sql` | — |
| Hide `MaintenanceRequests.notes` (internal staff notes) from landlords | Landlords cannot read internal notes via the API | **Done (WS-E)** — notes moved to `MaintenanceRequestStaffNotes` (staff/admin RLS); column dropped from `MaintenanceRequests` | Apply migration live after PR merge |
| ~~Run LGA-18 manual tests on live (approve tenant with link, approve landlord with link, landlord without link blocked, clear landlord link while approved blocked)~~ **DONE** (WS-H 2026-11-13) | End-to-end proof of the approve gates | Signed off via live SQL matrix + tenant/landlord shells; see Project store `internal/wave2-ws-h-manual-qa.md` | — |
| Landlord portal beyond thin read-only (create property, edit units, full dashboard) | Landlords self-serve portfolio | LGA-18 ships Properties + Maintenance read-only only | When landlord MVP is product-scoped |
| Codify `private.can_upload_maintenance_photo` into repo migrations (referenced by Phase 3; defined live-only today) | Secondary envs get photo helper without live dump | **Done (WS-E)** — `CREATE OR REPLACE` in `20261114030000_*` | Apply migration live after PR merge |
| Applications `date_of_birth` column (if product adds DOB) | Match “income/DOB PII” wording; keep admin-only RLS | Table today has `monthly_income` only (no DOB column) | If/when Applications schema adds DOB |
| Confirm/apply Phase 3 + Phase 5 migrations on any non-primary env (`20261113210000_*` … `20261113233000_*`) | Status history, storage ACL, `PropertyDocuments` + bucket match live | Applied to live Landlord Gopher; SQL on `master` (#10 / #11); other envs may lag | Before tenant submit / docs in that env |
| Confirm/apply LGA-15 migration `20261113242000_lga15_maintenance_status_category_checks.sql` on any env that predates the live CHECKs | Secondary envs get remapped legacy D1 statuses/categories + same CHECKs as production | Constraints already on live Landlord Gopher; remaps are no-ops there | Before standing up a new Supabase env / staging clone |
| Richer Accept & schedule UX (**WS-K**) — assign staff + date in one admin action | Faster admin intake; writes `scheduled_at` that a thin calendar can show | Phase 3 gates schedule fields; assignment still manual on the WO | Wave 3 **WS-K** (staffed) |
| **Thin read-only property calendar** (roadmap **#9** skinny / **WS-O**) — month view of existing dates only: WO `scheduled_at` / `next_follow_up_date`, lease start/end, rent `due_date`, optional application `desired_move_in`; click → existing detail pages | Staff at-a-glance schedule without a scheduling product | Owner **YES** for Wave 3; no create/drag/recurrence; prefer date-window + slim queries | Wave 3 **WS-O** (staffed; prefer after WS-K) |
| **Zillow sync research** only (roadmap **#10** / **WS-P**) — spike IDX/Zillow/ToS options and map to website `Listing` type; no production sync | Unblocks a go/no-go before listings syndication work | Owner **NO** for Wave 3 staffing; live listings still demo | Later when owner wants syndication options vs Jayla-supplied feed |
| **Website visual revisions** (roadmap **#11** / **WS-Q**, small brief only) — targeted CSS/layout/copy tweaks on `landlordgopherwebsite_` | Polish marketing site without a redesign | Owner **NO** for Wave 3 staffing | When owner reopens + short visual brief exists |
| ~~Automated RLS tests for tenant photo isolation + status history append-only~~ | ~~Regression safety~~ | **Done (WS-J)** — `tests/requirements/r4-maintenance-requests.test.ts` photo isolation + append-only history | Shipped with Wave 2 test expansion |
| Harden r7 tenant rent-charge exact-set assert (unfiltered list, not `.eq("id", …)`) once ledger fixtures move | Catches over-permissive RentCharges SELECT regressions | Medium leftover from WS-J phase-ship review; current assert still proves tenant can read own charge + tenant2 cannot | Next r7 test hygiene pass |
| Slim Users tenant-link query (id/name/email only) | Faster Users page | Phase 3 reused full `listTenants` enrich | Next Users UX pass |
| Split work-order-dialog into staff edit / tenant detail / media panels | Maintainability | Phase 3 shipped one dialog for DoD | Next maintenance UX pass |
| ~~Landlord documents UI (list/download own property docs)~~ | Completes landlord half of R5 in the portal | **Shipped** WS-F — landlord Documents nav + page (list/download); property panel upload/delete gated off for landlord | — |
| ~~Automated RLS tests for document visibility (tenant/staff/landlord isolation)~~ | ~~Regression safety~~ | **Done (WS-J)** — `tests/requirements/r5-property-documents.test.ts` visibility isolation | Shipped with Wave 2 test expansion |
| Property-documents MIME allowlist + attachment-only download | Blocks HTML/SVG open-in-tab via signed URL | Phase 5 ship used short TTL + download click; full MIME policy is product polish | Next docs security pass |
| Bind storage INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE to existing `PropertyDocuments.storage_path` | Closes staff orphan-upload / overwrite / arbitrary-path delete in bucket | **Done (WS-E)** — `20261114040000_property_documents_storage_path_bind.sql` (FE inserts metadata before upload) | Apply migration live after PR merge |
| Staff UPDATE of title/notes after admin widens visibility | Staff currently blocked by WITH CHECK `visibility = 'staff'` on non-admin | Admin-only visibility edits work; staff can delete+reupload | Next docs UX pass |
| Shared `formatBytes` / document row component | DRY staff + tenant document lists | Phase 5 ship focused on High ACL/perf fixes | Next docs UX pass |
| Paginate property documents beyond 200 | Large portfolios | Limit 200 shipped as High unbounded-list guard | When a property exceeds ~200 docs |
| Invite-only Auth (disable public signup) | Tighter staff onboarding | Product chose public signup → pending for Phase 2 | If abuse or unwanted signups appear |
| Paginate / status-filter `list_user_accounts_for_admin` | Faster Users page under large Auth fleets | Tiny fleets OK today; full `auth.users` scan on each load | When Auth user count grows or Users page feels slow |
| Slim Applications unit-options query (avoid full `listUnits` graph on page mount) | Faster Applications page open | Unit select only needs id/label/property; full enrich is heavier | Next Applications UX pass or when unit count grows |
| Manual Phase 2 QA: signup → verify → pending → admin Approve (with Staff link) / Reject / Suspend | Proves end-to-end account queue against real Auth + RLS | PR checklist left open; needs seeded admin session | Soon after Phase 2 deploy (AuthZ + Phase 1.5 verified live 2026-11-13) |

### Owner roadmap — easy add-ons (updated 2026-11-14 / WS-I)

| Roadmap | Wave 3 | Stream |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Portal URL / hosting **roadmap #3** (= hygiene **#13**) | **NO** — deferred until owner provides the link | deferred-work; **not** WS-I (≠ hygiene #3 payment anon revoke) |
| Accept & schedule | **YES** | **WS-K** |
| Thin calendar **#9** skinny | **YES** | **WS-O** |
| Zillow research **#10** | **NO** | deferred (**WS-P** not staffed) |
| Website visual **#11** | **NO** | deferred (**WS-Q** not staffed) |
| Staging + migration history | **YES** | **WS-I** (hygiene #8) — see ops `schema-migrations.md` § Staging / §E |

**Not** eng backlog: Jayla GitHub invite (roadmap **#12**) — owner access action.

### Wave 3 security & hygiene (staffed — 2026-11-14)

Backlog for **WS-S** / **WS-R** / **WS-I** (see Project store `docs/wave3-plan.md`). **Staffing approved**; S1 (#1–2) implemented in PR #33; I/K/N/O/R in flight. Order: **#1–2 first**, then S2 criticality **3→10→5→4→6**. **WS-L** is hold-only (item #12) — not a Wave 3 staffing target.

| # | Task | Stream / lane | Effort | Parallel w/ I/K/N/O? | Status |
|---|------|---------------|--------|----------------------|--------|
| 1 | Required GitHub CI checks on PRs/`master` | **WS-S S1** | S | Yes | **Done in PR #33** (owner still must mark check required) |
| 2 | Archive D1/Hono/Clawnify primary path; refresh stale IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN; retire `main`↔`master` `sync-branches.yml` (owner confirm) | **WS-S S1** | M | Yes | **Done in PR #33** (master-only) |
| 3 | Revoke `anon` (+ `PUBLIC` if needed) EXECUTE on payment RPCs (`record_payment` / `delete_payment`); keep `GRANT` to `authenticated`; verify privileges (mirror Phase 2) | **WS-S S2** | S | **No** other mig/RLS | Queued (serialize) |
| 4 | Last-admin guard on `admin_set_user_role` | **WS-S S2** | S–M | **No** mig overlap | Queued (serialize) |
| 5 | Require `email_confirmed_at` before Approve (+ Users badge) | **WS-S S2** | S–M | **No** mig overlap | Queued (serialize) |
| 6 | Enforce 5-photo **DB** cap per maintenance request (FE already slices to 5) | **WS-S S2** | S | **No** mig; avoid K dialog thrash | Queued (serialize) |
| 7 | Leaked-password protection + min length (Auth + UI) | **WS-S S3** | S | Yes | Queued |
| 8 | Staging + migration version / history repair | **WS-I** | M | I owns (not dual with S) | **Staffed** — status SoT: `docs/ops/schema-migrations.md` § Staging / §E |
| 9 | Login `?redirect=` (Phase 4b) — path-only; reject open redirects | **WS-R** | S | Yes | **Staffed** |
| 10 | Settings **admin-only** (RLS SELECT today `is_staff_or_admin`; staff still see Settings nav) | **WS-S S2** | S | **No** mig overlap | Queued (serialize) |
| 11 | Status label product decision → shared UI maps | Owner decision → FE | S after decision | Prefer after/near K, not during K mega-edit | **Owner decision still open** |
| 12 | Web push | **WS-L** hold | — | Do not staff | Phase 6 / R6 hold |
| 13 | Portal hosting/deploy + URL + website env (+ WordPress retirement / Next.js launch) | **deferred-work** (out of Wave 3) | — | Do not staff in Wave 3 | Wait until owner provides the link (**roadmap #3** = this item; ≠ hygiene #3) |
